## Headers and Footers

Per page header/footers can be created by putting a template in here, and then referencing it in the post's metadata.
They should be automatically picked up by the system, and populate a dropdown on edit/create.

As of this writing, only the series add/edit template support this, but it should be straightforward to add these to custom post types, or every post type.

You can also distribute your header and footer files in the templates directory of your theme by placing them in a headers/ or footers/ directory therein.
