=head1 tCMS Manual

=head2 First time setup

Run these makefile targets:

    make depend
    make install

From there, running tCMS is pretty simple:

    starman --enable-ssl --ssl-key $MY_KEY_PATH --ssl-cert $MY_CERT_PATH www/server.psgi

The application expects to run from the repository root.
The first time you open the application, you will be presented with a first-time page that tells you to load /login.

You will note that the submission button says 'Register' rather than 'Login'.
The first user which logs in will be set up as the administrator, and all further users must be made by them via the /post/about route.

You will want to do the following to make your user public:

=over 4

=item Create a user via the /post/about route using the name you just registered as.  This will require you to re-set your password.

=item Ensure the 'public' visibility is chosen when submitting the form.

=head2 Application Structure

server.psgi is a very straightforward application router which serves requests based on routing modules.
There are 3 routing modules you will need to know about:

=over 4

=item L<Trog::Routes::HTML> - Render various pages which (mostly) output text/html

=item L<Trog::Routes::JSON> - Implement various application/json output routes

=item Themed B<Routes> - Inside of any given theme in themes/ there will be a Routes.pm module defining custom routes for your theme.

=back

From there the routes are generally going to call out to the data model, which is configured via the /config route.
There are only two relevant things to configure, which is what Theme and Data model to use.

The configuration module is L<Trog::Config>.
The Data model modules are all subclasses of L<Trog::Data>.

We include a bogus data model for testing called 'DUMMY' which should not be used for production purposes.
It is useful as an example for developers: L<Trog::Data::DUMMY>

Authentication is accomplished via a cookie (tcmslogin) which we check against an sqlite database, config/auth.db
Passwords are hashed and salted, and the only other thing stored there is what ACLs users have.
The module controlling this is L<Trog::Auth>.

=head2 Theming

Themes are subdirectories of /themes, which mirror the structure of www/ internally.
Stylesheets are included after the mainline ones, so that your styles will override the default.
